Piano Genie
==============

Piano Genie allows anyone to improvise on the piano by mapping performances on a miniature 8-button keyboard to realistic performances on a full 88-key piano!

This repository is just a standalone clone of the [official Piano Genie demo](http://piano-genie.glitch.me). See the [blog post](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/pianogenie) for more info on Piano Genie, or our recent [ISMIR tutorial](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/music-cocreation-tutorial) for standalone training of Piano Genie.
